# Commit To Win

A git-based competition platform where developers compete by making commits to win prizes.

## Concept

Participants clone a repository at a specified time and must make a commit with specific requirements before the repository locks submissions. The latest valid commit wins the prize.

## How It Works

1. Repository opens at a predetermined time
2. Participants clone the repo and create required files
3. They commit with exact message and push to main branch
4. Repository locks after a short time window
5. Latest commit wins the prize

## Requirements

- Specific commit message format
- Required file with participant's information
- Force push to main branch
- Speed is key - only the latest commit wins
